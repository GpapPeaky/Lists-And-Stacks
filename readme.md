__.C FILES:__ NAMES ARE THIS WAY IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM FROM BEING SEPERATED IN FILE FROM BEING INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE OTHER FILES

__.C MAINS:__ MAIN FUNCTIONS IN THE .C FILES ARE ONLY FOR TESTS WILL BE REMOVED ONCE THE METHODS ARE COMPLETE

___STACK.C:__  IT CONTAINS ALL METHODS ASSOCIATED WITH STACKS

___ERROR.C:__ SIMPLE ERROR PRINTS FOR MANUAL DEBUGGING

___USERS.C:__    CONTAINS ALL METHODS ASSOCIATED WITH USER DATA

___MOVIES.C:__   CONTAINS ALL METHODS ASSOCIATED WITH MOVIE DATA

___FILTERED.C:__ CONTAINS ALL METHODS FOR THE FILTER COMMAND

___PRINTS.C:__ CONTAINS ALL PRINT FUNCTIONS

## Notes

> *Some Variables And Headers Have Been Initialised As **external** In The Header File. It Has Become Appearent That It Is Not Required And ,Frankly ,The Program Will Not Run If These Variables Are Declared As **external**.*

> *All List (& Stack) Headers And Tails Are Intialised As **NULL** .Later They Are Initialised As Something Else If It Is Required To Do So.*

> *It Is Required To **Compile All .c Files At The Same Time** (In The Same Command), In Order For The Program To Work *(Else It Hits Undefined Refrence Errors)*.*

> *AUXILARY DEFINITIONS: In Order To Avoid Mistakes And Arithemetic Conflict, Values For **SUCCESS (0)** And **FAILURE (-1)** Have Been Defined In `streaming_service.h`*.
